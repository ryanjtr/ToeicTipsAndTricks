Toeic Tips and Tricks documentation!
=================================================

Welcome to the TOEIC Tips and Tricks documentation! This resource is designed to compile the most effective TOEIC study strategies to help you reach your goals as quickly as possible.

The methods and tips here have been gathered from various contributors, not just myself. If you have any additional tips or strategies you'd like to share, please feel free to fill out the `Tips and Tricks form <https://forms.gle/atUsRTX32YLgWGtH8>`_.

.. note::

   Please avoid these ridiculous questions: **If I'm at 400, how long will it take to reach 650?** or **I'm going to take a test next month. Can I achieve my goal of 650 points?**

   Instead, focus on identifying your weaknesses and the methods that will help you achieve your goal efficiently.

Below, you'll find tips and strategies for each section of the TOEIC exam, as well as advice for the day before the test and what to expect in the exam room.
