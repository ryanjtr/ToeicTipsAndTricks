Imagine that a British marketing firm is doing research in your country. You have agreed to participate
in a telephone interview about public transportation

#. what are some advantages of taking public transportation?

    * There is a bus every 10 minutes at my dormitory`s bus stop
    * It only costs me 1 hundred thoudsand dong to buy a monthly ticket. It is cost-effective as I am

#. Think about the public transportation in your city. How can it be improved. Why do you think so? 

    * expand routes to cover more areas
    * the quality of air is higher
    * buses often arrive late -> i need punctuality of buses improve
    * increase the frequency of buses 
    * I think original buses should be changed to electric ones in order to decrease air pollution
